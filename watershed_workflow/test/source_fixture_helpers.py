"""One major problem of testing is that we need some real data, but
real data comes in big files (~GB) that we don't want to download, but
also don't want to save to our repo.

This helper works with source_fixtures.FileManagerMockNHDPlusSave to
save all needed HUCs to a couple of files, which can be put into the
repo, and are a much smaller file dataset.

To update the saved work files:

1. In source_fixtures.py:sources, replace FileManagerMockNHDPlus with FileManagerMockNHDPlusSave.
2. Run the tests, e.g. pytest watershed_workflow/test/
3. Run this script, e.g. python ./source_fixture_helpers.py within the test directory!
4. Change source_fixtures.py:sources back to FileManagerMockNHDPlus.

Note, you probably need to also commit the updated files to the repo!
