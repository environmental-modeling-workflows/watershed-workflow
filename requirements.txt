# NOTE: the requirements.txt listed here is VERY incomplete.  This is
# intentional -- most of the pip-based GIS packages don't correctly
# deal with dependencies on GIS libraries.  Instead, the majority of
# packages here MUST be installed via Anaconda or done manually.
# However, there are a few requirements that cannot be provided via
# conda, but CAN be provided via pip, so we get those here...
