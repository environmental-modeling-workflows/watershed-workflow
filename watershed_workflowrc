# Watershed workflow stores all data in a common library for shared
# use across the machine.  This directory defaults to:
#
# data_directory : ${WATERSHED_WORKFLOW_DIR}/data

# We rely extensively on downloaded files, which are certified via the
# SSL library.  Sometimes certificates are tricky, and if your
# certificates aren't working, it can be useful to try other
# certificate files, such as your system ones (likely installed
# somewhere like /etc/ssl/cert.pem ).  If you're really desparate and
# not worried about getting hacked, you can set this to False to not
# verify certificates, but that is not recommended.  Likely if you
# have trouble, the first thing to try is to update your certifi
# package in anaconda (conda update certifi)
#
# ssl_cert : True
